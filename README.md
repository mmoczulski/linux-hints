Hello guests! This is my first page on GitHub. I'd like to share with you all my Linux knowledge I've acquired during usage of this OS. I can't claim myself as a Linux guru or something. This page will contain all stuff which helped me to gain knowledge about Linux OS or helped me to configure my computer. Sometimes, those little hints and tips may be very specific and not always needed by you. Nevertheless, if you'll have any comment - please, don't hesitate and write it.

Regards,
Micha≈Ç Moczulski
